# TSNODE Sample API
This is a project that was written after [this post](https://tomanagle.medium.com/build-a-rest-api-with-node-js-typescript-mongodb-b6c898d70d61).


## Configs
The sampe.env is a .env file template to be configured individually after cloning.
It is to be noted that this file is only used by the api itself and not the docker files.
